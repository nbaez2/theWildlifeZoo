Q&A

I understood this project more as it tied everything together that I learned in class.

I feel I did well with the understanding of the different files and how they executed.

I think the code could use more of a database full of animals and could be a good starting point for a small company.

I believe the challenging part of the code was to tie Java to C++ through JNI. For example, IntelliJ does not support 2 operating code as such on the IDE? As far as I know. They have CLion which is C++ only and seperate from IntelliJ(Java). The files are not recognized. When you go to Visual code, I have a hard time getting them to sync and still trying to see how this works. What did work was adding the file to oyur command line to run the file using CD, LS, CAT, and pointing to the files. This allows you to bypass the JNI and create your own text file with for testing purposes.

I beleive the skills i learned will greatly help in future projects. Even if the code is not implemented in a real enviroment, you have the code to look back on for reference or guidance.

I feel making in-line comments will help in making the GitHub community and public understand the system and what it is supposed to do and how it is executed.
